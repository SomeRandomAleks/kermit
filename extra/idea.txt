Idea 1:

Kermit accounts where kermits fight eachother
the winning kermit gets a certain number of cash deposited into their account
Cash is represented with "©"

Add an embed for whenever a kermit is gonna fight, but the kermit they want to fight will also have to accept the fight or else it won't work

ECONOMY LEVELS:

< © 90,000 | Poor Class
~ © 90,000 - © 110,000 | Middle Class
> © 110,000 | Upper Class

> © 1,000,000 | God Class

Anyone in God Class can virtually change the economy and how it works
They can't change it by too much though, only around © 5,000 + or - and they have a 1 week cooldown
Example:

The economy is defaulted to these levels:

< © 90,000 | Poor Class
~ © 90,000 - © 110,000 | Middle Class
> © 110,000 | Upper Class

> © 1,000,000 | God Class


If a God Class member changes the economy, they can only change it by © 5,000

If someone adds © 5,000 to the default economy then the levels will change to this:

< © 95,000 | Poor Class
~ © 95,000 - © 115,000 | Middle Class
> © 115,000 | Upper Class

> © 1,005,000 | God Class

Middle Class might not be affected since they will also get their Middle Class max threshold increased
In fact, the only members that will be affected by this change will be the Poor Class since they will need © 5,000 more to get to Middle Class


PLAYER CASH:

If a player wants to get more cash they can do so by battling other players
Battles go like this:

User: !battle <@member> <©>
Bot: Great! <@member> do you want to battle <User> or do you want to increase the cash amount?


The amount of cash will be the amount each player will be playing for, it cannot be less than © 5,000
If <@member> wants to increase the gamble then they will say "increase" then the new amount

Example:

User: !battle <@member> 5,000
Bot: Great! <@member> do you want to battle <User> or do you want to increase the cash amount?
<@member>: increase 10,000
Bot: Great! User do you want to keep this amount or increase it?

a user can cancel the command by using "cancel"
Note:

A user can cancel the command with "cancel" if the member they want to bettle hasn't answered yet
However, if the member they want to battle increases the amount, then the user will have to use "forfeit" to cancel the command
If a user uses "forfeit," then they will lose the amount they originally wanted to battle for

Example:

User: !battle <@member> 5,000
Bot: Great! <@member> do you want to battle <User> or do you want to increase the cash amount?
<@member>: increase 10,000
User: forfeit
Bot: User has lost © <©>


When the battle starts, a random fight picture will be displayed
When the battle ends and a winner has been chosen the winner will be rewarded with the amount the battle started with
The loser of the battle will lose the amount they each played for
